Tcl Runlog
-------------
a runner's workout logging tool
in tcl/tk with sqlite db
by Tony Baldwin

This is barely started (as of 20140107, because
I just started building it today).

TclRunlog requires:
Tcl/Tk 
SQLite3 

TclRunlog is cross-platform.
Win and Mac folks, get tcl from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl
and SQLite3 from http://www.sqlite.org

Linux folks, install those with your favorite package manager (apt, yum,
whatever). Make sure you install sqlite3, not sqlite (older, incompatible
version, still available on Debian and some other repos, but sqlite3 is also
available).

I may eventually package this up for win folks in tclkit so you'll just have an executable binary.

Released according to the Gnu Public License v.3 or later.
