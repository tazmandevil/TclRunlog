Tcl Runlog
-------------
a runner's workout logging tool
in tcl/tk with sqlite db
by Tony Baldwin

This is barely started (as of 20140107, because
I just started building it today).

TclRunlog requires:
Tcl/Tk 
SQLite

TclRunlog is cross-platform.
Win and Mac folks, get tcl from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl
and SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org

Linux folks, install those with your favorite package manager (apt, yum, whatever).

I may eventually package this up for win folks in tclkit so you'll just have an executable binary.

Released according to the Gnu Public License v.3 or later.
